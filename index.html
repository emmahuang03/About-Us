    <h1>[About Us]</h1>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3>Our goal is to expose minorities to more technological opportunities in an attempt to close the racial gap in STEM. Minorities can find STEM related opportunities in their community to get involved it. We find events that are targeted towards minorities so that they can find tech events more efficiently. Starting in our local Seattle area, we hope to expand our audience to other regions in an effort towards equality for all in the STEM world.</h3>
